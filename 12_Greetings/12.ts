// 12. Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, 
// but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. 
// The text of each message should be the same, 
// but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

const names = ["Raheel", "Amjad", "Zubair", "Nomeel"];

names.forEach ((item, index) => console.log (`${item}, How are you doing today?`));
