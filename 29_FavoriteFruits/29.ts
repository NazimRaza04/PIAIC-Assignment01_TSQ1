// 29. Favorite Fruit: Make a array of your favorite fruits, 
// and then write a series of independent if statements that check 
// for certain fruits in your array.

// • Write five if statements. Each should check whether a certain kind of fruit
// is in your array. If the fruit is in your array, the if block should 
// print a statement, such as You really like bananas!
